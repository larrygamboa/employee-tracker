## User Story
As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## Purpose

The purpose of the homework is to build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

The application will run as a Node CLI to gather information. The command-line application should allow users to:
    1) Add departments, add roles, add employees
    2) View departments, view roles, view employees
    3) Update employee roles

A database schema is required and should contain three tables: department, role, and employee.
